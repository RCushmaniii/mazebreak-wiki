# Visual Style & Art Direction

## 14.1 Art Style

MazeBreak uses a stylized, semi-low-poly 3D art style that is clean, readable, and performant within Roblox's rendering system. The aesthetic is darker and more atmospheric than typical Roblox games, but not gritty or realistic. Think "colorful dungeon" rather than "dark souls."

## 14.2 Visual Priorities

- **Readability first:** enemies, hazards, and loot must be instantly distinguishable from environment
- **Enemy silhouettes are distinct** across all archetypes; players identify enemies by shape before detail
- **Damage type effectiveness** uses consistent color language: orange/red = fire, blue/white = freeze, yellow flash = explosive
- **Loot rarity** uses consistent color glow: white = common, green = uncommon, blue = rare, purple = epic
- **Environmental lighting** communicates danger: darker areas signal higher-threat zones

## 14.3 Color Language

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Orange / Red | Fire damage, danger, high damage |
| Blue / White | Freeze damage, ice, control effects |
| Yellow Flash | Explosive damage, high impact |
| Green | Healing, positive effects, uncommon loot |
| Purple | Epic/rare items, special effects |
| Gray / Muted | Resisted damage, ineffective attacks |
| Gold | Premium loot, boss rewards, coins |

## 14.4 Environmental Design

- Maze walls have visible height and depth, creating a sense of enclosure
- Lighting is used to guide players toward exits and points of interest
- Dangerous areas use darker or warmer lighting to signal threat
- Safe areas (hub, stage entry) use cooler, brighter lighting
- Environmental props tell stories: broken weapons, scattered coins, scorch marks from previous adventurers

## 14.5 Seasonal Themes (Live Ops)

Each season introduces a visual theme that reskins existing stage templates without changing gameplay mechanics:

- **Stone Dungeon** — default theme (gray stone, torches, wooden doors)
- **Ice Caverns** — frozen walls, blue lighting, icicle hazards
- **Volcanic Depths** — lava pools, orange glow, cracked stone
- **Shadow Realm** — dark purple, ethereal effects, floating debris
- **Overgrown Ruins** — vines, moss, natural light through cracks

Themed cosmetics match each season's visual identity.
