# Enemy Design System

Enemies in MazeBreak are designed around threat tiers, behavioral roles, and damage affinities. Difficulty comes from pattern mastery and decision-making, not hidden rules.

## 6.1 Enemy Threat Tiers

| Tier | Damage | Behavior | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Tier 1: Basic | Low–Moderate | Clear, predictable patterns | Teach positioning and timing | Common, early stages |
| Tier 2: Advanced | Moderate–High | Faster, layered, deceptive | Punish panic and greed | Mid-stages onward |
| Tier 3: Elite | Very High | Multi-phase patterns | Tension spikes, mini-boss feel | Rare, used sparingly |
| Tier 4: Boss | Massive / Lethal | Large, readable patterns | Mastery encounters | Stage milestones only |

## 6.2 Enemy Archetypes

### Zombie (Flesh-Based)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Movement | Ground-based, slow, persistent |
| Damage | Low to Moderate |
| Role | Pressure and spacing control |
| Punishes | Standing still too long |
| Weakness | Fire (burns flesh), Explosive |
| Resistance | None |

Zombies are forgiving but relentless. They teach new players the basics of positioning and spacing.

### Ghost (Ethereal)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Movement | Floating, phases through walls |
| Damage | Moderate |
| Role | Timing and patience test |
| Punishes | Rushing blindly |
| Weakness | Spell/Energy attacks |
| Resistance | Physical (less effective) |

Ghosts teach patience and timing. They require players to wait for vulnerability windows.

### Goblin (Agile Humanoid)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Movement | Fast, erratic |
| Damage | Moderate to High |
| Role | Reaction speed and awareness |
| Punishes | Poor reflexes |
| Weakness | Freeze (halts mobility), Explosive |
| Resistance | None |

Goblin danger comes from speed, not durability. They test reaction time and awareness.

### Orc (Heavy Humanoid)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Movement | Slow, deliberate |
| Damage | High |
| Role | Commitment punishment |
| Punishes | Greedy attacks |
| Weakness | Explosive, Fire (slightly) |
| Resistance | Physical (armored) |

Orcs reward patience and spacing. They punish players who commit to attacks too aggressively.

### Stone Monster (Construct)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Movement | Slow, tanky |
| Damage | Very High |
| Role | Area denial and zoning |
| Punishes | Bad positioning |
| Weakness | Explosive / Vibration |
| Resistance | Physical |

Stone monsters create battlefield control challenges. They force players to navigate around danger zones.

## 6.3 Late-Game Variants

Variants reuse base archetypes with one added mechanic: ranged attack, shield, trap-summoning, or explosive behavior. Variants may gain one new resistance or one new weakness, but never exceed one additional complexity layer beyond the base archetype.

Possible variant mechanics:

- **Ranged attackers** — base archetype gains a projectile attack
- **Shielded enemies** — must be flanked or hit from behind
- **Trap-summoning enemies** — place hazards on the ground during combat
- **Explosive enemies** — deal area damage on death

## 6.4 Enemy Design Rules

- Players learn the enemy system organically through play, not menus
- No enemy is immune to any damage type
- Affinities increase or reduce damage taken but never create hard counters
- Visual and audio feedback clearly communicates enemy state and vulnerability
- If later playtesting shows confusion, the affinity system can be simplified to "Effective" vs "Normal" damage only (no resistances)
