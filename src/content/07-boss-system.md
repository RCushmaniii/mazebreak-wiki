# Boss System

## 7.1 Mini-Bosses

- Appear mid-stage or in special optional areas
- Stronger than normal enemies with 1–2 unique attack patterns
- Defeating a mini-boss spawns a treasure chest with guaranteed valuable loot
- Optional: players can bypass mini-bosses but miss the reward

## 7.2 Main Bosses

- Appear at major stage milestones (every 5–10 stages)
- Pattern-based combat with clearly telegraphed phases
- Deal massive or lethal damage; require full pattern mastery
- Always fought in fixed-camera arenas with full visibility
- Multi-phase encounters where patterns evolve as health decreases

## 7.3 Boss Victory Rewards

- Celebration animation with visual effects and sound
- Guaranteed level-up or significant XP award
- Unique loot drop (cosmetic or high-tier equipment)
- Progression unlock: access to next difficulty tier or stage group
- Battle Pass XP bonus for boss kills

## 7.4 Boss Design Rules

- No off-screen attacks; all threats visible within the fixed camera arena
- No hidden hazards or ambiguous damage sources
- Attack patterns are learnable within 2–3 attempts
- Boss difficulty comes from execution, not memorization of lengthy sequences
- Co-op bosses scale health and damage for two players

> **Design Rule:** Boss fights are the ultimate test of skill mastery. Every death during a boss fight should teach the player something new about the pattern. If a player can't identify what killed them, the boss design has failed.
