# Retention & Live Ops

## 17.1 Daily Engagement Hooks

| Hook | Mechanic | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Daily Login Reward | Escalating rewards for consecutive days | D1 retention |
| Daily Challenge | One specific objective per day | Directed daily engagement |
| Battle Pass Dailies | 3 daily tasks that award BP XP | Recurring session motivation |
| Rotating Shop | Daily cosmetic rotation at discount | FOMO-driven check-in |

## 17.2 Weekly Engagement

- **Weekly challenges:** harder objectives (defeat 10 bosses, clear 5 stages with no damage) for bonus XP and gems
- **Weekly leaderboard reset:** compete for top rankings each week
- **Weekend events:** double XP or special themed stages

## 17.3 Seasonal Content Cadence

Each season (6–8 weeks) introduces:

- A new visual theme with reskinned stages
- Themed cosmetics for Battle Pass
- A new Battle Pass track (free + premium)
- Potentially a new boss encounter or enemy variant

Seasonal content gives returning players fresh experiences without requiring new core mechanics.

## 17.4 Retention Targets

| Metric | Target | Roblox Benchmark |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| D1 Retention | 40%+ | Top games: 40–50% |
| D7 Retention | 20%+ | Top games: 20–30% |
| D30 Retention | 10%+ | Top games: 10–15% |
| Avg Session Length | 15–25 min | Platform avg: ~15 min |
| Sessions per Day | 1.5–2 | Engaged players: 1.5–2.5 |

## 17.5 Retention Design Philosophy

Retention is built into the game's systems, not bolted on as an afterthought. The daily login rewards, Battle Pass, and weekly challenges all serve the same goal: give players a reason to come back tomorrow. But the foundation of retention is the core gameplay loop — if the game isn't fun, no amount of daily rewards will keep players engaged.
