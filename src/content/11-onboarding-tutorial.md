# Onboarding & Tutorial Flow

The first 60 seconds of gameplay determine whether a new player stays or leaves. MazeBreak uses a guided first-run experience that teaches through play, not text walls.

## 11.1 First-Run Sequence

| Step | What Player Does | What They Learn |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Spawns in a simple corridor | WASD movement |
| 2 | Encounters a slow, harmless target dummy | Attack button |
| 3 | Sees first coin drop | Collecting loot |
| 4 | Reaches a small chest | Opening chests, inventory |
| 5 | Encounters first Tier 1 enemy (Zombie) | Combat basics, taking damage |
| 6 | Finds a healing potion | Using consumables |
| 7 | Reaches the exit door | Stage completion loop |
| 8 | Sees level-up screen | Progression system |

The tutorial stage takes 2–3 minutes and is only played once. After completion, players enter the hub and begin normal gameplay. The tutorial uses environmental design and pacing to teach; minimal on-screen text.

## 11.2 Progressive System Introduction

| Stage Range | New Mechanic Introduced |
|------------|------------------------|
| 1–3 | Basic movement, attack, loot collection |
| 4–6 | Shield blocking, multiple enemy types |
| 7–10 | Damage affinities (visual feedback shows effectiveness) |
| 11–15 | Mini-bosses, keys, large chests |
| 16–20 | First main boss, advanced trap patterns |
| 20+ | Full system mastery assumed; all mechanics active |

## 11.3 Onboarding Design Rules

- Teach one mechanic at a time; never stack multiple new concepts
- Use environmental cues over text prompts wherever possible
- Allow players to fail safely before consequences are real
- The tutorial should feel like gameplay, not a separate mode
- Experienced players should be able to move through quickly without feeling held back
