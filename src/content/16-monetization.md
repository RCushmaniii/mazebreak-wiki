# Monetization Design

## 16.1 Core Principle

**Sell expression, not power.** Players should never be able to buy combat advantages. Everything purchasable is cosmetic, convenience, or progression-accelerating. Nothing purchasable is progression-gating. This principle directly supports the Skill Over Luck pillar.

## 16.2 Revenue Tiers

### Tier 1: Cosmetics (Primary Revenue)

- **Character skins and outfits:** themed armor sets with no stat changes
- **Weapon skins:** visual variants of weapon classes (flaming sword skin, crystal dagger, etc.)
- **Trail effects:** movement particles and footstep effects
- **Victory animations:** custom celebrations after boss kills
- **Pets and companions:** visual-only followers (high demand with 9–14 age demographic)

### Tier 2: Convenience (Secondary Revenue)

- **Inventory expansion:** carry more potions and items per run
- **Stage select:** replay completed stages without replaying earlier ones
- **Cosmetic loot preview:** see what visual appearance is in a chest before opening

### Tier 3: Battle Pass (Recurring Revenue)

- **Free track:** coins, basic cosmetics, potions earned through play
- **Premium track (Robux purchase):** exclusive skins, pets, trail effects, emotes
- **Season duration:** 6–8 weeks per season
- **Each season** introduces a new visual theme with themed cosmetics

## 16.3 Pricing Framework

| Item Type | Price (Robux) | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Basic Skin | 75–150 | Accessible impulse purchase |
| Premium Skin Set | 300–500 | Aspirational, high visual quality |
| Pet | 150–350 | High demand with younger players |
| Battle Pass | 400–500 per season | Standard Roblox pricing |
| Trail Effect | 100–200 | Low creation cost, high margin |
| Inventory Expansion | 200–300 | One-time purchase |

## 16.4 What Is Never Sold

- Weapons with better stats than earnable weapons
- Health boosts, damage multipliers, or defense bonuses
- Extra lives or death forgiveness
- Keys or chest-opening advantages
- Anything that creates a pay-to-win advantage

## 16.5 Revenue Reality Check

Roblox takes approximately 75% of all Robux transactions. A 100 Robux purchase nets the developer roughly $0.0875 through DevEx. This means volume is critical: the game needs a large, engaged player base before monetization generates meaningful income. Prioritize retention and player satisfaction over aggressive monetization.

> **Design Rule:** Monetization should NOT be in the MVP. Ship the game for free first. Prove retention. Add the shop and Battle Pass once you have real player data.
