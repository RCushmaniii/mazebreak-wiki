# Risk Register

| # | Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Scope creep delays launch | High | High | Strict MVP scope; cut features, not quality |
| 2 | Combat does not feel good | Critical | Medium | Prototype combat in Sprint 1; iterate before building more |
| 3 | Stages feel repetitive | High | Medium | Build 15+ diverse templates; randomize enemy placement |
| 4 | Co-op networking complexity | High | High | Phase co-op to post-launch; ship solo first |
| 5 | Low D1 retention | Critical | Medium | Invest in onboarding; test first 60 seconds heavily |
| 6 | Monetization feels predatory | High | Low | Cosmetic-only policy; never sell power |
| 7 | Two-person team burnout | High | High | Realistic sprint durations; scope to 3–4 month MVP |
| 8 | Poor Roblox discoverability | High | Medium | Social features at launch; lobby, leaderboards, ghost runs |
| 9 | Performance issues on lower-end PCs | Medium | Medium | 20 enemy cap; stage despawn system; asset budget |
| 10 | Enemy AI too simple or too complex | Medium | Medium | Start simple; add complexity only after playtesting |

## Risk Management Rules

- Review risks at the start of each sprint
- If a risk materializes, address it immediately rather than deferring
- Scope reduction is always preferable to timeline extension
- If combat doesn't feel right in Sprint 0/1, iterate there until it does — don't build on a weak foundation
- Recruit 2–3 outside playtesters in Sprint 7 to identify blind spots
