# Economy, Loot & Progression

## 9.1 Currency System

| Currency | Value | Source | Use |
|----------|-------|--------|-----|
| Copper Coin | 1 | Common drops, small chests | Basic shop purchases |
| Silver Coin | 5 | Mid-stage drops, enemies | Equipment upgrades |
| Gold Coin | 10 | Rare drops, boss rewards | Premium shop items |
| Gems | Special | Large chests, boss kills, Battle Pass | Cosmetics, special items |

## 9.2 Gem Types

| Gem | Rarity | Primary Source |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| Sapphire | Common gem | Large chests |
| Emerald | Uncommon gem | Mini-boss rewards |
| Ruby | Rare gem | Boss rewards, risk-reward stages |
| Diamond | Very Rare gem | Main boss kills, Battle Pass premium track |

## 9.3 Equipment

### Weapons

Each weapon class (Dagger, Sword, Bow, Spell) has tiered variants that increase in stats. Higher-tier weapons may carry damage affinity bonuses (fire sword, explosive arrows, etc.).

### Shields

| Shield | Block % | Weight | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Wooden Small Shield | Low | Light | Starting / shop |
| Wooden Large Shield | Medium | Heavy | Chests |
| Metal Small Shield | Medium | Light | Rare chests |
| Metal Large Shield | High | Heavy | Boss drops |

### Helmets

| Helmet | Defense Bonus | Special | Source |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Basic Helmet | Small | None | Shop / early chests |
| Horned Helmet | Medium | Slight melee boost | Mid chests |
| Gemmed Helmet | High | Affinity bonus | Boss drops / rare chests |

Defense affects damage reduction, mistake forgiveness, and the balance between aggressive vs cautious playstyles.

## 9.4 Consumables

| Item | Effect | Duration | Rarity |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| Healing Potion | Restores health (up to max) | Instant | Common |
| Speed Potion | Increases movement speed | 15 seconds | Uncommon |
| Keys | Opens large chests | Single use | Rare |

## 9.5 Chest & Loot System

| Chest Type | Requires Key | Possible Contents |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Small Chest | No | Coins, basic weapons, small shields, potions |
| Large Chest | Yes | Gems, advanced weapons, rare armor, rare potions |

Loot encourages exploration, optional danger, and replayability. Chests in more dangerous locations contain better loot on average.

## 9.6 Progression & Level-Up System

Players earn XP from defeating enemies, completing stages, and killing bosses. XP accumulates toward level-ups that improve core stats.

| Stat | Effect of Level-Up | Feel Change |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Damage | Increased base damage | Enemies fall faster |
| Health | Increased max HP | More room for mistakes |
| Run Speed | Faster movement | More responsive, fluid navigation |
| Jump Height | Higher jumps | Access new shortcuts and paths |
| Attack Speed | Faster attack rate | More aggressive playstyle viable |

> **Design Rule:** Level-ups must change how the game feels, not just how numbers scale. A player at level 10 should play noticeably differently than at level 1.
