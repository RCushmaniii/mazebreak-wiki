# Design Pillars

These three pillars are non-negotiable. Every feature, system, and design decision must support at least one. If a proposed feature conflicts with any pillar, it is rejected.

## Pillar 1: Skill Over Luck

- Enemy behavior is predictable and learnable through observation
- Player positioning, timing, and decision-making matter more than RNG
- Randomization adds variety to stage layouts, not chaos to combat
- No pay-to-win mechanics that bypass player skill
- Damage affinities reward smart play but never require it

## Pillar 2: Meaningful Progression

- Level-ups change how the game feels, not just how numbers scale
- Gear meaningfully alters survivability and playstyle
- Boss kills feel like major milestones with real celebration
- Cosmetic progression provides visible status and achievement
- Each session should feel like progress toward something

## Pillar 3: Risk vs Reward

- Optional enemies and chests create player-driven risk decisions
- High-risk paths offer better rewards but greater danger
- Players choose how aggressive or cautious they play
- Co-op amplifies risk/reward through shared consequences
- The meta loop rewards consistent engagement over single heroic runs
